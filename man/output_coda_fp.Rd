\usage{
output_coda_fp(
  jagsmod,
  format = "mvn",
  refstudy = NULL,
  treatments = attr(jagsmod, "trtnames")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{jagsmod}{an object of class `"rjags"` that contains the results of a
fractional polynomial model.}

\item{format}{Can take `"mvn"` to output parameters for multivariate normal
distribution, or `"coda"` for a full set of MCMC samples (given as a matrix)}

\item{refstudy}{Name of the study to use as reference when making predictions.
`refstudy` must either match a name in `attr(jagsmod, "studynames")` or can be
left as `NULL` (the default) for parameters for the reference curve not to be
included in the coda.}

\item{params}{A vector of parameter names corresponding to those in the model
to extract values for.}
